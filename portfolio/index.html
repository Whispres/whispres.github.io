      <h3> Quick Reference Phlebotomy Guide </h3>
      <li> <b>Software:</b> Microsoft Word 2016 </li>
      <li> <b>Featured Skills:</b> Information Design, Chemistry Knowledge, Health Sciences </li>
        <p>
        This phlebotomy guide is a visual aid for nurses and lab technicians.
        It provides quick access to blood collection and specimen transport
        information, but is not an exhaustive list of all sampling protocols.
        Users are expected to be fully trained and the guide acts as a quick
        reference or reminder. The hospital name is fictional and information
        has been altered to protect the content owner's privacy.

        This template provides a general discussion of developing a nonclinical
        laboratory SOP. Examples and suggestions are included for implementing
        statistical information, procedure data, health and safety concerns,
        regulatory requirements and best style practices.

      <h3> API Endpoint URL Map </h3>
      <li> <b>Software:</b> Microsoft Visio 2016 and Postman </li>
      <li> <b>Featured Skills:</b> RESTful API, CURL and Diagram Design </li>
      <p>
        API endpoint URL maps are designed to help users quickly navigate and
        consume API endpoints. During API development, the map provides an
        overview of the API architecture and visualizes basic resource information.
        This map features a list of the parameters available for the resources
        and their associated methods. API information included in this map was
        derived from CURL testing and Postman.
